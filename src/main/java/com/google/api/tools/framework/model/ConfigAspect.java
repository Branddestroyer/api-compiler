/**
 * Represents an abstraction of a configuration cross-cut, like documentation, http, auth, etc. In
 * order to integrate a configuration aspect into the system, this interface should not be directly
 * implemented, instead extend one of the abstract base classes implementing this interface in the
 * {@code aspects} package.
 *
 * <p>Processing of aspects is performed in three phases:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>Merging: During this phase the configuration is merged with the protocol definition.
 * Essential validation of the configuration is performed, and errors are reported. Attributes may
 * be added to the model representing information relevant to the aspect.</li>
 *
 * <li>Linting (style checking): During this phase, additional, non-essential validation is
 * performed on the model. This phase is optional and produces warnings.</li>
 *
 * <li>Normalization: In this phase the configuration is re-build in a normalized form, as it is
 * expected by downstream tools.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * Each phase is preluded by a method call to indicate its start, followed by a call to each model
 * element, followed by a call indicating the end of the phase.
 *
 * <p>Config aspects can communicate with each other by attaching attributes to the model.
 * Attributes are usually synthesized during the merging phase. If one aspect depends on another's
 * attributes in the merging phase, the dependency must be specified using the
 * {@link #mergeDependencies()} method.
